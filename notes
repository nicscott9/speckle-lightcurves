The X-axis is frame number within the 320 taken in the sequence, each at 3 seconds.
The Y-axis is inst. Magnitude.
This is a binary WD+WD eclipsing system, so I doubt if a secondary eclipse will be seen. Usually one is a DA, 1.2M-sun, earth size, the other is a HE WD, 0.2 M-sun, much larger in radius.
The proposal says the mid-eclipse times are:
BJD(TDB) = 2458429.78643(7) + 0.037 041 44(1)E

Nic and Andy,
Here is what I have. We observed four eclipses for this object, UT 2/16, 2/17 (2) and 2/18. Each time series had 320 frames of 3 sec each taken at 512 X 512 pixels and in SDSS g,i. I have used only the g frames (best S/N) and assume the i frames are similar in timing, but we should check.
I took each of the b frames (SDSS g) and produced a photometric light curve using aperture photometry. I sent you the .png files of them yesterday and attach here zooms of the eclipses. I call the 2/17 datasets “a” and “b”. I also attach the actual light curve files, 2 columns of frame number within the 320 and inst., magnitude.  2/18 was by far the best seeing and S/N night, 17 a perhaps the worst, the others were ok. I believe the eclipse is total – i.e., flat bottomed (see 18 light curve) and we are seeing variations near eclipse bottom due to simply no flux from the star being received -sky bg only. I have not binned or co-added the data in any way – which I might do if I was publishing it, but wanted full resolution here to find the mid-eclipse value.
I also attach the fits headers (in a .docx file) for the three multi-extension fits files (fours eclipses, three files, 2/17 has 2 eclipses observed).
The object is ZTF0220+2141 and the proposal says the mid-eclipse times are (Period ~53.28 min):
BJD(TDB) = 2458429.78643(7) + 0.037 041 44(1)E

For mid-eclipse times, I did three things:
Eyeball estimate to get near the ball park in each light curve and to examine the data – look at your data
I used Argelander’s method to provide a good estimate of the mid-eclipse time to make sure my #3 was accurate
I made a Gaussian fit to each eclipse and determined the mid-eclipse time. See plot below.
These three methods all agreed, the fitting being most accurate however.

The mid-eclipse times (in frame number) are (in fractions of frames of 3 sec each) – each is about +/- 0.01-0.02 trying repeated Gaussian fits. If I were publishing, I’d phase each eclipse and put together as binned data, removing outliers, and show a binned beautiful light curve from which to do science of ingress and egress. ;-)  and then could iterate on the true mid-eclipse etc. But this work should show us how well we did or did not do.
UT date    Mid-eclipse in fraction of frame number
2/16     155.5221
2/17a   141.4742
2/17b     79.9147
2/18       56.6787
Thus, we will need to
Convert our start time from JD or MJD at start exposure to BJD
Look at the timing in the files for the frames
Find the time at mid-eclipse for each eclipse in fractional frames
Compare to the predicted time from ephemeris
See how well we did ;-)

The timestamps in N20200216A0230b.fits are fairly consistent with starting at ~6:19:03 UTC and ending at ~6:35:03 UTC:
OBSTIME =      1581833942.5149 / UTC at start of obs = 2020-02-16 06:19:02.5149 UTC
Timing table [0] - 3.0011s = 1581833942.848955 =       2020-02-16 06:19:02.848955 UTC

File creation time: 2020-02-15 20:35:04.000 -1000 =    2020-02-16 06:35:04.0 UTC
Note that I have assumed that the timing table values are the *end* of each exposure and extrapolated the starting and ending times.
The only FITS header keyword that doesn't match is:
TIMEOBS = '05:28:30'           / from speckle.scope.timeobs
If we observed eclipse 12580 at BJD_TDB  2458895.76776478,
I think that corresponds to approximately 2020-02-16 06:26:45 UTC,
which would have been ~7m42s after the start of the 16-minute observation, or exposure ~154 of 320.
Does this match what you found for the center of this eclipse?
If I do the calculation a bit more carefully it looks like:
eclipse center = 2020-02-16 06:26:46.619 UTC
Using the timing table:
observation start = 2020-02-16 06:19:02.849 UTC
exposure number =  (6:26:46.619 - 6:19:02.849) / 3.0011 = 154.533
This looks suspiciously off by one exposure (2.964s).
Working backward from the measured eclipse time:
observation start = 6:26:46.619 - 155.5211 * 3.0011s = 06:18:59.885

to Andrew, me
https://www.timestamp-converter.com
OK, using this web-site (most do not give fractional seconds and I’d suggest we calc. this ourselves)
I get for the four eclipses 2/16, 2/17a, 2/17b, 2/18
UTC at start of observation      Date Time
1581833942.5149                         2020-02-16 06:19:02.514
1581917199.5959                         2020-02-17 05:26:39.595
1581920591.6140                        2020-02-17 06:23:11.614
1582003876.5604                        2020-02-18 05:31:16.560
These start times and the ephemeris etc. translate into the following start times in BJD
2458895.762393612
2458896.725925104
2458896.765180723
2458897.729035291
Yielding, using the ephemeris and period of the EB, the following frames in the sequences
154.064363
140.992864
77.249912
54.877535
I found mid-eclipse values of
155.5221
141.4742
79.9147
56.6787
So, we are ahead in all eclipses by
1.457737
0.481336
2.664788
1.801165
Thus, I conclude
1) We are not just off by a frame in count
2) Are we using the correct time as a start time (UTC at start of observation) and how accurate is that time? (note here, my UNIX seconds to date is not super accurate)
3) Are all the differences, up to nearly 8 seconds, simply an ephemeris issue?

I only did the blue images as they had good S/N.
The file names are:
N20200216A0230b.fits    N20200217A0319b.fits    N20200217A0320b.fits    N20200218A0536b.fits
Yes, I’d think that if the ephemeris is off, we see a constant and/or increasing error, (might not change much in a few days). Good point.
So not sure why they are not consistently off in some way.

Dear Nic and Andy,

Let me walk through an example for the 2/16 (first) eclipse and see if this makes sense
Using the UTC at start of obs = 2020-02-16 06:19:02.5149 UTC, I converted this to BJD using the website calculator
http://astroutils.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/time/utc2bjd.html
with the observatory set to CFHT (they did not seem to have Keck or Gemini of Mauna Kea but CFHT is close enough, and the RA DEC of the star
The start time converted to 2458895.762393612 BJD
Taking the eclipse ephemeris (in BJD) and its difference from the star time, I get
2458895.762393612 – 2458429.78643 = 465.9759636 (BJD) days that have past.
Using the binary period of 0.03704144 days, the start of our observation occurred at 12579.85552 cycles of the binary. This means that we need to go 1-0.85552 more cycles to get to phase 0.0 (the eclipse) or 0.14448 in phase. This gives 0.14448 * 0.03704144 = 0.005351747 days of time or 462.39 sec.
Taking the KCT value (I assume this is what to use as it is the cycle time) of 3.001195 sec / frame
Then 462.3909408 sec / 3.001195 sec/frame =   frame number 154.0689428
I find the mid-eclipse centroid in my fitting of 155.5221
So , if we repeat this for the other three eclipses, and fine that each is not quite at the predicted time, I think we can believe that errors in the EB ephemeris (start and period) are the issue and that we are not just off by 1 frame somehow.  If we always get the same “delta” from the prediction to the measured value) then I think we have some frame issue.

Hi Steve and Nic,

Hi Steve,

I went about it a different way and used the timing table starting value, and I confirm your numbers to within a second or so:
